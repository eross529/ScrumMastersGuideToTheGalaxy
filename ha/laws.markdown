Laws you should know
====================

#Conways Law
In 1968 Mel Conway observed:
"Any organization that designs a system (defined more broadly here than just information systems) will inevitably produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure."

Bascially this comes into play when want change your architecture of your software, you also have to change your orginizational structure. 

Conway's Law is talked about a lot in Continous Delivery and DevOps.

#Brooks' Law
* Brooks' Law says basically adding more people to complete a late project that is failing will not work due to the cost of time do to hiring, training, etc... 
* But David Anderson, the Kanban Guru, suggests that it is more an issue for methods like waterfall, where you don't start developing until almost half way or more thru the project timeline because busy trying make "perfect requirements".  This means you won't know you are in trouble until it is too late. If your using an agile process like Kanban or Scrum, where not waiting to start project until everything is defined and starting getting feedback asap, it is possible to identify early on that project needs more folks and sucessfully scale up.

#Larman's Law

1. Organizations are implicitly optimized to avoid changing the status quo middle- and first-level manager and “specialist” positions & power structures.

2. As a corollary to (1), any change initiative will be reduced to redefining or overloading the new terminology to mean basically the same as status quo.

3. As a corollary to (1), any change initiative will be derided as “purist”, “theoretical”, “revolutionary”, "religion", and “needing pragmatic customization for local concerns” — which deflects from addressing weaknesses and manager/specialist status quo.

4. Culture follows structure.
